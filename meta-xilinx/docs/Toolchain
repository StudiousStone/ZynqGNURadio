Configuring External Toolchain
==============================

In order to build with an external toolchain some additional configuration must
be set in the build environments local.conf. First configure the use of an
external toolchain, including the location to the toolchain:

	TCMODE = "external-xilinx"
	EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN = "<path to toolchain>"

WARNING: There is a known issue with the MicroBlaze Linux toolchain provided by
XSDK 2013.3 where certain shift instructions are not generated correctly, avoid
using this toolchain. Use the newer XSDK 2013.4 or PetaLinux 2013.10 toolchains.
